=head1 NAME

natas15 - solve level 15 of overthewire.org's Natas server-side security war games

=head1 VERSION

version 0.003

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<natas15> [ password ]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<overthewire.org|http://www.overthewire.org/wargames/> has a series of war games.
Natas is the server-side security challenge.

Level 15 requires you to do blind SQL injection. Guessing each one-character
slice of a 32-character password is tedious and prone to errors if done manually,
so this script automates the process. You will be prompted interactively for the
password to access this level. If you prefer to run noninteractively, you can
give the password as the first argument on the command line, but note that the
password will be visible to other users on the system.
